### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently diving deep into my PhD in Information Engineering Technology, where I'm all about crafting a scalable platform for real-time immersive holographic communications. Back in my master's days, I soaked up a ton of knowledge in IT and engineeringâ€”programming, electronics, you name it. Projects have been my playground, where I've fine-tuned my software chops and knack for working in teams and individually.

When I'm not buried in projects, you'll find me tearing it up outdoors, whether it's windsurfing or hitting the slopes for some skiing action. But it's not all adrenaline; I'm big on giving back. From animating youth programs to leading student societies, I'm all about making a positive impact. Oh, and did I mention I teach windsurfing too?

Excited to keep growing, I'm ready to tackle whatever challenges come my way. With my skills and passion, I'm all in to solve real-world problems and make life better for everyone.
